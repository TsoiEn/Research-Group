Smart Contract-Driven Machine Learning Models
### MediChain: An Implementation of Blockchain in a Patient Data Repository with Homomorphic Ecryption for Decentralized Healthcare Query

**Description** MediChain leverages Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain, to ensure only authorized participants can access sensitive patient data, aligning with healthcare privacy needs. Smart contracts, or chaincode, written in languages like Go, JavaScript, or Java, can implement simple ML models (e.g.,linear regression, logistic regression or decision trees) to handle encrypted patient data using homomorphic encryption, ensuring privacy. Fabric's channels and private data collections enable selective data sharing and isolated environments for sensitive data, allowing controlled access. Its modular design supports customizable consensus algorithms like RAFT, balancing privacy, performance, and fault tolerance in ML-driven predictions.

**Approach:** Implement simple ML models (like linear regression or decision trees) within smart contracts for applications requiring lightweight, on-chain computations.

**Blockchain Role:** The blockchain can execute these smart contracts to perform basic predictions based on verified data inputs directly within the network.

**Use Case:** In a patient repository, smart contracts could use an on-chain model to classify high-risk and low-risk patients based on certain data inputs. For example, they might analyze medication adherence data to flag potential non-compliance cases, triggering an alert. In a patient repository, an encrypted patientâ€™s health data can be processed for disease risk predictions without revealing the data. Blockchain stores and verifies encrypted results, maintaining privacy while providing useful ML insights.
